## About

MintPlant is a project where anyone can plant a tree and generate an NFT that represents that tree with its location (latitude/longitude), photo, and species details. The platform will also have a map that shows the impact generated by the community around the world.


## Stack

- api: NodeJS + Typescript + ExpressJS
- webapp: ReactJS + Typescript
- Filecoin + IPFS

TODO: Add more info about stack


## Running in Production

### Option 1 - Docker (Recommended)

You can run this application using docker:

```
docker run -p 4000:4000 strandgeek/mintplant:latest
```


### Option 2 - Build the project

1 - Clone this repository

2 - Go to the webapp and build it:

```
cd webapp
npm install
npm run build
```

3 - Go to the api and build it:
```
cd ../api
npm install
npm run build
```

4 - Run the API
```
npm start
```

The server should listen on port 4000 and it already serves the webapp static build.


## Development

To setup the development environment, follow these steps:

1 - Clone this repository

2 - Go to the webapp and start it:

```
cd webapp
npm install
npm start
```

2 - In another terminal, go to the api and start it

```
cd ../api
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application should run on http://localhost:4000. The api will serve the webapp as proxy
